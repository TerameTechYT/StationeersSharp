    [h1]Better Water Combustor[/h1]
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.
    See: https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods
    
    Makes H2/Water combustor will no longer have micromoles of hot water that will flow into your condensation valves.
    This does not remove any water, you will still get 100% of the water you produce, however it will be added to the combustor as steam instead of liquid water.

    you can also go here to get the dll itself if you want to just put it in your bepinex/plugins folder:
