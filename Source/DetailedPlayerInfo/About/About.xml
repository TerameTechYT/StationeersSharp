    [h1]Detailed Player Info[/h1]
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.
    See: https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods

    [h2] Info Display Changes:[/h2]
    Makes the info windows on the bottom right more informal by untruncating the numbers it displays.
    You can also quickly enable between viewing celsius and kelvin temperatures by holding "K" ingame.
    [i] also fixed a small bug with the day counter being "0" when you first enter a world.[/i]
    
    [h2] FPS Counter Features:[/h2]
    FPS Text is now "*FPS* / *Cap* FPS"
    FPS Cap will now actually be set (on caps below 60) and will not render numbers above the cap.
    FPS Counter is a bit shorter due to removal of latency.
    
    [h2] Battery and Filter Warning Percentages:[/h2]
    There is now percentages on battery and filter status alerts.
    You can now close your suit window for less screen clutter!!
    
    you can also go here to get the dll itself if you want to just put it in your bepinex/plugins folder:
