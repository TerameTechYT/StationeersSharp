![Image](../../img/dpi_kelvin.png) <br>
> Makes the info windows on the bottom right more informal by untruncating the numbers it displays. <br><br>
> also fixed a small bug with the day counter being "0" when you first enter a world. <br><br>
> You can also quickly enable between viewing celsius and kelvin temperatures by holding "K" ingame. <br><br>

> FPS Text is now "*FPS* / *Cap* FPS" <br><br>

> FPS Counter is a bit shorter due to removal of latency. <br><br>
